## Overview

This repository is a personal project designed to track and showcase my programming progress for coursework or projects related to computer science. While it references UCD, I am a student and not affiliated with UCD in any official capacity. This repository serves as a centralized location for storing my code for future reference.

## Features

- Organized structure for easy access of certain exercises
- Refined, tested code accepted on Moodle
- Inclusion of each exercise's instructions at the top of the files
